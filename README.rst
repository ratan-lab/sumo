**sumo** is a command-line tool to identify molecular subtypes in multi-omics datasets. It implements a novel nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to identify groups of samples that share molecular signatures, and provides additional modules to evaluate such assignments and identify features that drive the classification.

To see how **sumo** performs the joint factorization of patient-similarity networks and through integration of multi-omic data
identifies significantly different molecular subtypes of LGG

For practical details about **sumo** analysis pipeline, examples of downstream analysis and troubleshooting
please refer to our published `STAR Protocol <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666166721008169>`_ and/or `package documentation <https://python-sumo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html>`_.


Installation
------------
You can install **sumo** from PyPI, by executing command below. Please note that we require **python 3.6+**.

.. code:: sh

    pip install python-sumo

(March 2021): We have noted an installation issue with the *llvmlite* package (required for one of **sumo** dependencies). To avoid errors with installation, **upgrade pip to a >19.0 version**.

Usage
-----

**sumo** consists of four subroutines. A typical workflow includes running *prepare* mode for preparation of similarity matrices from feature matrices, followed by factorization of produced multiplex network (mode *run*). Third mode *evaluate* can be used for comparison of created cluster labels against biologically significant labels. A fourth mode *interpret* can be used to detect the importance of each feature in driving the classification.

prepare
^^^^^^^
Generates similarity matrices for samples based on biological data and saves them into multiplex network files.
